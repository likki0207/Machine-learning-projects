# Machine learning:
Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

## Project-1 - Recommendation system
A simple Movie Recommendation Python Recommendation is done using "cosine similarity" between certain features of the movies. In this we are having a huge dataset consisiting of 4809 movies and we have 24 different columns. The name of the dataset is "movie_dataset.csv"

### -> Steps to implement this project:
Step 1: Read CSV File

Step 2: Select Features

Step 3: Create a column in df which combines all selected features

Step 4: Create count matrix from this new combined column

Step 5: Compute the Cosine Similarity based on the count_matrix

Step 6: Get index of this movie from its title

Step 7: Get a list of similar movies in descending order of similarity score

Step 8: Print titles of first 5 movies

## Project-2
## Project-3 - Predicting the salary of an employee based on his/her years of experience
In this project we will be using Simple linear regression model. In statistics, simple linear regression is a linear regression model with a single explanatory variable. That is, it concerns two-dimensional sample points with one independent variable and one dependent variable (conventionally, the x and y coordinates in a Cartesian coordinate system) and finds a linear function (a non-vertical straight line) that, as accurately as possible, predicts the dependent variable values as a function of the independent variable.
In this we are using a very small datset having only 2 columns, i.e., YearsExperience	and the Salary.

Following is the plot obtained for training set results:
