# Machine learning:
Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

## Project-1 - Recommendation system
A simple Movie Recommendation Python Recommendation is done using "cosine similarity" between certain features of the movies.

### steps to implemet this project:
Step 1: Read CSV File

Step 2: Select Features

Step 3: Create a column in df which combines all selected features

Step 4: Create count matrix from this new combined column

Step 5: Compute the Cosine Similarity based on the count_matrix

Step 6: Get index of this movie from its title

Step 7: Get a list of similar movies in descending order of similarity score

Step 8: Print titles of first 5 movies
